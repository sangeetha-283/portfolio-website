# Simple Portfolio Website

This is my **first portfolio project** built with only **HTML and CSS**.  
It is a very simple static website that includes:

- 🏠 Home page  
- 📩 Contact page  

## 🚀 Features
- Basic HTML structure (`div`, `h1`, `p`, `a`, `ul`, `li`, `form`, etc.)
- Simple CSS styling (colors, fonts, spacing)
- Beginner-friendly layout

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3

---

✨ This project is just a practice step for learning **web development**.
